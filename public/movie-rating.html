    <h1>The Best Movies According to Jeffri</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>Grave of the Fireflies</h3>
    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095327/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_grave" target="_blank"><img src="../assets/images/gravefireflies-poster.png" height="200px" alt="Grave of the Fireflies Movie Poster" /></a>
    <p>
      This movie, Grave of the Fireflies, really left a mark on me. It's the story
      of two siblings, Seita and Setsuko, who lose their parents during World War
      II. All alone, they have to fight to survive. The animation is amazing, and
      the film does a great job of showing the emotional toll of war. It's a really
      sad story, but it's also an important one.

    <h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_7_nm_1_q_the%2520shaws" target="_blank"><img src="../assets/images/shawshank-poster.png" height="200px" alt="The Shawshank Redemption Movie Poster" /></a>
    <p>
      This movie, The Shawshank Redemption, really left a mark on me. It's the story
      of Andy Dufresne, a man who is wrongly convicted of murder and sent to prison.
      Despite the bleakness of his situation, Andy never gives up hope. He befriends
      a fellow inmate, Ellis "Red" Redding, and together they find ways to make the
      best of a terrible situation. The film is slow-paced, but it's beautifully
      shot and the acting is superb. It's a powerful story about the importance of
      hope and friendship, even in the darkest of times.
    </p>

    <h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_1_nm_7_q_forrest" target="_blank"><img src="../assets/images/forrestgump-poster.png" height="200px" alt="Forrest Gump Movie Poster" /></a>
    <p>
      This movie, Forrest Gump, is both funny and heartwarming. It tells the story
      of Forrest Gump, a man with a low IQ who somehow finds himself at the center
      of many important historical events. The film is full of humor, but it also
      explores some serious themes, like war and violence. Despite his challenges,
      Forrest is a kind and innocent man who makes the best of every situation. He's
      a character you can't help but root for. <br />
      <br />And if you're looking for a film that will make you laugh, cry, and
      think, Forrest Gump is definitely worth watching.
